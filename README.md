This repository will include a video to demonstrate our proof of concept. 
Our industry partners requested that the code developed for the project be kept private, so I will be respecting that request.

Our project aims to add some automation and technological assistance to what is currently, a completely manual process. 
<Industry> employs plant biologists who constantly gather information about their crops and growth strategies to review and study. 
This process is done by hand, and our project aims to automate the gathering of these metrics, as well as storing them, performing some analytics, and providing this data to a web dashboard for review and study. 
On top of that, we’ve created an augmented reality app which will use this data to recreate a plant’s growth in real time via an android device.
